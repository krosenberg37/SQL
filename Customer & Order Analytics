#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
select COUNT(orderid) from BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select COUNT(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
where Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
Select distinct acctnum from BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID = BIT_DB.customers.order_id
where length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID' ;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
select Product, MIN(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select Product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, location
    from BIT_DB.FebSales
    where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select COUNT(*), AVG(price*quantity) as AVG_spent
    from BIT_DB.customers cust
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
    ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
    where Quantity > 2
    AND Quantity <> 'Quantity Ordered'
    ORDER BY AVG_spent;
    
#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
Group by Product
